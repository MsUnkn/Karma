To Do:

Clean up Harmony and Shadow Orbs Bar
Fix DebuffHighlight
(Fix Raid Assistant/Raid Icon stuff when oUF updates that) DONE


If you have any issues with the MoP Version please post full error for me to look over. You can message it to me
on wowinterface or post it on the oUF_Karma MoP Beta comments.

There should be minimal issues. I know that raid icons/assist icons do not show. I'm sorry I will get
around to it. Consider it a beta since you are in beta you should be used to unusual quirks.

I have working versions of Monk Harmony Bar ie CHI and Spriest Shadow orbs in layout.You need to install the
respective plugins written by Tukz until oUF updates to include these.
